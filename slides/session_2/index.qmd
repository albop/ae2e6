# Introduction and Basic Facts

## Why a small open economy?


What are the classical reasons to open economy to trade?

::: incremental

- trade integration 
    - taste for variety
    - comparative advantage
- financial integration
    - smooth shock / insurance

## From RBC to IRBC

RBC models have been  very successful at matching Business Cycles

- (temporary) victory against keynesian view that short term fluctuations result from demand shocks
- so successful that facts at odd with theoretical predictions have been called "puzzles"

. . .

It didn't take long before the same methodology was applied to International Business Cycles

. . .

Seminal Paper: 

- [*International Real Business Cycles*](papers/Backus-InternationalRealBusiness-1992.pdf), Backus, Kehoe, Kydland (1992) (freshwater economists)

Very successful methodology:

# Modeling a Small Open Economy

## Endowment model

Representative agents maximizes:
$$\max_{c_t} \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \beta^t u(c_t)$$
$$c_t + a_{t} \leq y_t + (1+r) a_{t-1} $$

::: r-stack

:::: {.fragment .current-visible}

__Endowment economy__:

- income $(y_t)_t$ is exogenously given
- for simplicity we assume it is deterministic

__Small open economy__:

- *open*:  can save $a_t$ which yields $a_{t+1}(1+r)$ in the next period
- *small*: country takes world interest rate $r$ as given (no effect on world prices)

::::
:::: {.fragment .current-visible}

We solve this problem with the terminal conditions:

- $a_{-1}$ given[^initial_condition]
- $\lim_{T\rightarrow\infty} \frac{a_{T}}{(1+r)^T}\geq0$ 

    - *no-ponzi* condition

The no-ponzi condition will in effect eliminate diverging solutions.

In a first order approximation, it selects the right eigenvalues.

::::
:::

[^initial_condition]: Note that initial condition is compatible with the dynare conventions we use here.

## Endowment model (3)

We get the lagrangian:

$$\mathcal{L}= \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \beta^t u(c_t) + \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \beta^t \lambda_t \left(y_t + (1+r) a_{t-1} - c_t-a_{t} \right)$$


First order conditions:

\begin{align}
u^{\prime}(c_t)& =& \lambda_t \\
 \lambda_t &=& \beta (1+r) \lambda_{t+1}
\end{align}


Under the *technical assumption* $\beta (1+r)=1$ we get $c_t=c_{t+1}$ then

$$c_0 = \frac{r}{1+r}\left\{ (1+r) a_{-1} + \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \frac{y_t}{(1+r)^t}\right\}$$

. . .

::: {.incremental}

- consumption is determined by permanent income
    - changes in initial wealth have permanent effects
- *remark*: problem isomorphic to consumption-savings decisions

:::

## Current Account


::: {.callout-tip title="Reminders on Current Account"}

The __trade balance__ is exports-imports (here $y_t-c_t$)


The __current account__ is trade balance + net factor payments (here $y_t-c_t+r a_{t-1}$)

Positive __current account__: additional lending to the rest of the world.

:::

. . .


Using the formula from before

$$CA_0 =  a_{-1} r + (1-\frac{r}{1+r}) y_0 - \frac{r}{1+r}\left\{ \sum_{t\geq1}^{\infty} \frac{y_t}{(1+r)^t}\right\}$$



How does the current account reacts to income shocks?


- current account responds positively to *temporary* shock in income

- and to news about future income shocks:
    - This is the *intertemporal approach* to the current account


## Unit root

Still with the same formula:
$$c_0 = \frac{r}{1+r}\left\{ (1+r) a_{-1} + \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \frac{y_t}{(1+r)^t}\right\}$$

What is the effect of an increase in $a_{-1}$?

    - consumption rises permanently
    - $a_t$ is constant, equal to $a_{-1}$
    - agent consumes small amount $r$ corresponding to interests paid forever on $a_{-1}$

- this will correspond to a unit root in the solution
<!-- 
## Exercise

From the first order conditions 


\begin{align}
u^{\prime}(c_t) & = & \lambda_t \\
\lambda_t & = &  \beta (1+r) \lambda_{t+1}
\end{align}


assuming $u(c_t) = \log (c_t)$, can you get the equation for the law of motion of $a_t$  and show the presence of a unit root?
 -->

## Adding capital

We add capital and production to our endowment economy:
$$y_t = z_t k_{t-1}^\alpha$$
$$k_t = (1-\delta) k_{t-1} + i_{t}$$

The aggregate resource constraint becomes:

$$a_{t} + c_t + i_t = (1+r) a_{t-1} + y_t$$

Now maximize $\sum_t \beta^ t U(c_t)$

. . .

We get first order conditions

$$\lambda_t = \beta \lambda_{t+1} (1+r)$$
$$\lambda_t = \beta \lambda_{t+1}\left[ (1-\delta) + z_{t+1} f^{\prime}(k_{t}) \right]$$

where $\lambda_t$ is lagrange multiplier associated to budget constraint.


## Adding capital: optimality conditions


Since $\lambda_t>0$ (constraint is always binding), we get:

$$(1-\delta) + z_{t+1} f^{\prime}(k_{t}) = 1+r$$

$$k_{t} = \left( \frac{r+\delta}{\alpha z_{t+1}}\right)^{\frac{1}{\alpha-1}}$$

and investment $$i_t = \left( \frac{r+\delta}{\alpha z_{t+1}}\right)^{\frac{1}{\alpha-1}}- (1-\delta)\left( \frac{r+\delta}{\alpha z_{t}}\right)^{\frac{1}{\alpha-1}}$$


. . .

Here investment is fully determined by productivity shocks

- too simple: no international dependence

<!-- 
## The elusive gains of financial integration

Side note:

Cf: Gourinchas and Jeanne *The elusive gains from financial integration.
The immediate adjustment of capital provides an upper bound on the gains from financial integration.
 -->

## Add friction to the investment


A possible solution: change the resource constraint such that adjusting capital is costly

For instance:

$$a_{t} + c_t + i_t + \frac{\omega}{2}\frac{(k_{t}-k_{t-1})^ 2}{k_t} = (1+r)a_{t-1} + z f(k_{t-1})$$

$$k_{t} = (1-\delta) k_{t-1} + i_t$$

where $\omega$ is an adjustment friction.

. . .

Typically, $\omega$ is chosen so that the model replicates $\frac{Var(i_t)}{Var(y_t)}$ from the data.

- small open economy model with production, consumption-leisure tradeoff and capital adjustment costs
    - = RBC+open+adj costs
- perform some moments matching
- compare different ways of stationarizing

## The model

$$\max_{c_t, n_t} \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \beta^t u(c_t, n_t)$$

$$c_t + k_{t} + a_{t} = y_t + g_t - \frac{\omega}{2}(k_{t}-k_{t-1})^2 +(1-\delta) k_{t-1} + (1+r^{\star}+{\color{red}\pi(a_{t-1})})a_{t-1}$$
$$y_t = f(k_{t-1}, n_t, z_t)$$

$$z_{t+1} = \rho z_t + \epsilon_{t+1}$$

and $$u(c, n) = \frac{1}{1-\sigma}\left(c^{\psi}(1-n)^{1-\psi}
)\right)^{1-\sigma}$$


. . .


The term $\color{red}\pi$ is there to make the model stationary.


## How to make the distribution stationary?

The solution of the model exhibits a unit root:

$$a_t = a_{t-1} + ... \text{other variables in t-1} + \text{shocks in t}$$

. . .

Problem:

- there isn't a unique deterministic steady-state
- the ergodic distribution of the model variables is not defined

This raises practical issues (notably for estimation) for the *linear* model.

- no unconditional moments

## How to get rid of the unit root?

*General idea*:

- introduce a force that pulls the level of foreign assets towards equilibrium

Schmitt Grohe and Uribe (2003) consider many options:

::: r-stack

:::: {.fragment .current-visible}

- debt-elastic interest rate:
    $$1+r = 1+r^{\star} + \pi(a_d)$$
    - with $\pi(0)=0$ and $\pi^{\prime}(0)>0$
    - $\pi$ can be understood as a risk premium on rising debt

::::

:::: {.fragment}

- endogenous time-discount (aka Usawa preferences) 
    $$\beta(c_t) = (1+c_t)^{-\chi}$$
- costs of adjustment for international portfolios

SGU show that the choice of the stationarization device has little effect for the dynamics (moments) of most variables

## Conclusions

- The model matches unconditional correlations fairly well
    - The stationarization device has little effect on the moments
- Unconditional correlations are not that great
    - a limitation of the moment matching method?
- Correlation of consumption with output is too high
    - and probably cross-correlation of consumption too low
    - still the Backus-Kehoe-Kydland puzzle...
