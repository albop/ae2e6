# Introduction and Basic Facts

## Why a small open economy?


What are the classical reasons to open economy to trade

::: incremental

- trade integration 
    - taste for variety
    - comparative advantage
- financial integration
    - smooth shock / insurance

## From RBC to IRBC

After the success of RBC models to match business cycles it didn't take long before the same methodology was applied to International Business Cycles

. . .

Seminal Paper: 

- [*International Real Business Cycles*](papers/Backus-InternationalRealBusiness-1992.pdf), Backus, Kehoe, Kydland (1992) (freshwater economists)

Very successful methodology:

- facts at odd with theoretical predictions have been called "puzzles"

# Modeling a Small Open Econmomy

## Endowment model

Take an endowment economy: income $(y_t)_t$ is exogenously given. We assume it is deterministic

$$\max_{c_t} \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \beta^t u(c_t)$$

$$c_t+a_{t+1} \leq y_t + (1+r) a_t$$

Country takes world interest rate $r$ as given 

- a small open economy doesn't affect world prices


## Endowment model (2)

We solve this problem with the terminal conditions:

- $a_0$ given
- $\lim_{T\rightarrow\infty} \frac{a_{T+1}}{(1+r)^T}\geq0$ 

    - *no-ponzi* condition

. . .

The no-ponzi condition will in effect eliminate diverging solutions. In a first order approximation, it selects the right eigenvalues.

## Endowment model (3)

We get the lagrangian:

$$\mathcal{L}= \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \beta^t u(c_t) + \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \beta^t \lambda_t \left(y_t + (1+r) a_t - c_t-a_{t+1} \right)$$


First order conditions:

\begin{align}
u^{\prime}(c_t)& =& \lambda_t \\
 \lambda_t &=& \beta (1+r) \lambda_{t+1}
\end{align}


Under the *technical assumption* $\beta (1+r)=1$ we get:

$$c_0 = \frac{r}{1+r}\left\{ (1+r) a_0 + \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \frac{y_t}{(1+r)^t}\right\}$$

. . .

- problem isomorphic to consumption-savings decisions
- consumption is determined by permanent income

## Current Account


::: {.callout-tip title="Reminders on Current Account"}

The __trade balance__ is exports-imports (here $y_t-c_t$)


The __current account__ is trade balance + net factor payments (here $y_t-c_t+r a_t$)

Positive __current account__: additional lending to the rest of the world.

:::

. . .


Using the formula from before

$$CA_0 =  a_0 r + (1-\frac{r}{1+r}) y_0 - \frac{r}{1+r}\left\{ \sum_{t\geq1}^{\infty} \frac{y_t}{(1+r)^t}\right\}$$



How does the current account reacts to income shocks?


- current account responds positively to *temporary* shock in income

- and to news about future income shocks:
    - This is the *intertemporal approach* to the current account


## Unit root

Still with the same formula:
$$c_0 = \frac{r}{1+r}\left\{ (1+r) a_0 + \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \frac{y_t}{(1+r)^t}\right\}$$

What is the effect of an increase in $a_0$?

- consumption rises permanently
    - by small amount $r$ corresponding to interests paid forever on $a_0$
- this will correspond to a unit root in the solution

## Exercise

From the first order conditions 


\begin{align}
u^{\prime}(c_t) & = & \lambda_t \\
\lambda_t & = &  \beta (1+r) \lambda_{t+1}
\end{align}


assuming $u(c_t) = \log (c_t)$, can you get the equation for the law of motion of $a_t$  and show the presence of a unit root?


## Adding capital

We add capital and production to our endowment economy:
$$y_t = z_t k_t^\alpha$$
$$k_t = (1-\delta) k_{t-1} + i_{t-1}$$

The aggregate resource constraint becomes:

$$a_{t+1} + c_t + i_t = (1+r) a_t + y_t$$

Now maximize $\sum_t \beta^ t U(c_t)$

. . .

We get first order conditions

$$\lambda_t = \beta \lambda_{t+1} (1+r)$$
$$\lambda_t = \beta \lambda_{t+1}\left[ (1-\delta) + z_{t+1} f^{\prime}(k_{t+1}) \right]$$

where $\lambda_t$ is lagrange multiplier associated to budget constraint.


## Adding capital: optimality conditions


Since $\lambda_t$ (constraint is always binding), we get:

$$(1-\delta) + z_{t+1} f^{\prime}(k_{t+1}) = 1+r$$

$$k_{t+1} = \left( \frac{r+\delta}{\alpha z_{t+1}}\right)^{\frac{1}{\alpha-1}}$$

and investment $$i_t = \left( \frac{r+\delta}{\alpha z_{t+1}}\right)^{\frac{1}{\alpha-1}}- (1-\delta)\left( \frac{r+\delta}{\alpha z_{t}}\right)^{\frac{1}{\alpha-1}}$$


. . .

Here investment is fully determined by productivity shocks

- too simple: no international dependence

<!-- 
## The elusive gains of financial integration

Side note:

Cf: Gourinchas and Jeanne *The elusive gains from financial integration.
The immediate adjustment of capital provides an upper bound on the gains from financial integration.
 -->

## Add friction to the investment


A possible solution: change the resource constraint such that adjusting capital is costly

For instance:

$$a_{t+1} + c_t + i_t + \frac{\omega}{2}\frac{(k_{t+1}-k_t)^ 2}{k_t} = (1+r)a_t + z f(k_t)$$

$$k_{t+1} = (1-\delta) k_t + i_t$$

where $\omega$ is an adjustment friction. Typically, $\omega$ is chosen so that the model replicates $\frac{Var(i_t)}{Var(y_t)}$ from the data.

    - = RBC+open+adj costs
- perform some moments matching
- compare different ways of stationarizing the model

## The model

$$\max_{c_t, n_t} \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \beta^t u(c_t)$$

$$c_t + k_{t+1} + a_{t+1} = y_t + g_t - \frac{\omega}{2}(k_{t+1}-k_t)^2 +(1-\delta) k_t + (1+r^{\star}+\pi(a_t))a_t$$
$$y_t = f(k_t, n_t, z_t)$$

$$z_{t+1} = \rho z_t + \epsilon_{t+1}$$

and $u(c, n) = \frac{1}{1-\sigma}\left(c^{\psi}(1-n)^{1-\psi}
)\right)^{1-\sigma}$



## How to make the distribution stationary?

The solution of the model exhibits a unit root:

$$a_t = a_{t-1} + ... \text{other variables in t-1} + \text{shocks in t}$$

. . .

Problem:

- there isn't a unique deterministic steady-state
- the ergodic distribution of the model variables is not defined

This raises practical issues (notably for estimation) for the *linear* model.

- no unconditional moments

## How to get rid of the unit root?

*General idea*:

- introduce a force that pulls the level of foreign assets towards equilibrium

Schmitt Grohe and Uribe (2003) consider many options:

::: r-stack

:::: {.fragment .current-visible}

- debt-elastic interest rate:
    $$1+r = 1+r^{\star} + \pi(a_d)$$
    - with $\pi(0)=0$ and $\pi^{\prime}(0)>0$
    - $\pi$ can be understood as a risk premium on rising debt

::::

:::: {.fragment}

- endogenous time-discount (aka Usawa preferences) 
    $$\beta(c_t) = (1+c_t)^{-\chi}$$
- costs of adjustment for international portfolios

. . .

SGU show that the choice of the stationarization device has little effect for the dynamics (moments) of most variables

## Conclusions

- The model matches unconditional correlations fairly well
    - The stationarization device has little effect on the moments
- Unconditional correlations are not that great
    - a limitation of the moment matching method?
- Correlation of consumption with output is too high
    - and probably cross-correlation of consumption too low
    - still the Backus-Kehoe-Kydland puzzle...
