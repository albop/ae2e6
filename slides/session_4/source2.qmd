bayesian estimation
banks and financially constrained households and firms.

basic model + richer version

questions:
- disruption from redistribution (default)
- credit standards -> cycle
- asset prices for business fluctuations


model = RBC + 
financial frictions on banks, households, firms

estimation:
differentiate between
    - usual shock
    - new *financial* shocks (redistribution, credit squeezes asset price shocks)
fin shocks explain recessions

idea: busimess cycles are financial rather than real

literature: banks as intermediaries between savers and borrowers. Recent contributions include Brunnermeier and Sannikov
