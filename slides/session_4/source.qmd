CREDIT MARKET STRESS AND THE ECONOMY
At times, banking and credit markets become stressed, increasing the cost of borrowing and reducing the availability of credit.
Credit market stress has macroeconomic consequences:
• Contributed importantly to the Great Depression of the 1930s
• Helps explain why the recession that followed the global financial crisis of 2007-
2009 was so severe
• Helps explain the persistence of even “garden-variety” recessions
• Helps explain the potency of monetary policy
• Justifies a strong response to systemic financial crises when they happen and
effective financial regulation to ensure that they happen less often

THE SIMPLE ECONOMICS OF LENDING

Lending to private borrowers typically involves imperfect and asymmetric
information. Borrowers know more than lenders about their own financial capacity,
plans, and risks. Because of asymmetric information, lenders face adverse selection (the riskiest borrowers have the strongest incentives to apply) and moral hazard (borrowers have insufficient incentive to take care).
Banks and other lenders specialize in overcoming information problems through
longer-term relationships, screening, monitoring, imposing restrictions on borrowers (covenants), and requiring collateral. 


The external finance premium (EFP) is the all-in cost of a loan for a given borrower    (including costs created by covenants and collateral requirements, etc.), less the safe rate of interest (for example, yields on government securities).
The EFP reflects the lender’s cost of credit intermediation for that borrower. EFPs typically differ by borrower: A small business will have a higher EFP than a financially strong corporation.
However, EFPs tend to move together as the economy changes. When we talk about
“the EFP,” we mean the typical or average EFP across the economy. A higher EFP
corresponds to more stressed credit markets.

Banks also must borrow from ultimate savers. For reasons explored by laureates
Diamond and Dybvig, banks typically rely on short-term funds (deposits, uninsured
commercial paper, or repurchase agreements). Lenders to banks like the liquidity (easy
 conversion to cash) of their short-term loans.
However, reliance on short-term funding makes banks vulnerable to panics (runs), in which (uninsured) providers of short-term funding lose confidence and rush to withdraw their funds.
Panics, or the threat of panics, make lenders more cautious (the flight to quality).
They become less willing or able to use their accumulated information, relationships, etc. to extend credit to otherwise trustworthy borrowers.

A key insight is that the cost of lending (EFP) depends importantly on the financial health (net worth) of both borrowers and lenders.
When the net worth of borrowers is high, borrowers can bear more of any losses,
creating a financial cushion for lenders and incentivizing borrowers to take care. For example, banks prefer to extend credit to homebuyers who make large down payments.
Lender net worth also matters. For example, banks with lots of capital and cash on hand available to absorb losses find it easier to attract funding and avoid panics.

The (average) EFP both affects and is affected by the state of the economy:
1) A higher EFP (more stressed credit markets) implies tighter credit standards and
reduced lending, which slows the economy.
2) A weaker economy in turn reduces the financial health/net worth of both lenders and borrowers, raising the EFP.

THE GREAT RECESSION
The Great Recession of 2007-2009 was largely the result of credit disruptions.
The financial system of 2007 looked very different from 1929. Commercial banks were
no longer dominant. A large share of credit was provided by the “shadow banking
system,” for example, investment banks, mortgage companies, money market funds,
off-balance-sheet investment vehicles.
The shadow banking system, ineligible for deposit insurance or (normally) for Federal
Reserve loans, nevertheless relied heavily on uninsured, short-term funding
(commercial paper, repurchase agreements) and thus was vulnerable to runs.
